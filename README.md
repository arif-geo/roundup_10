# roundup_10
This function will roundup any given value to nearest 10. If &lt;0, then it will roundup     to lesser multiples of 10.      For example, -2.135 will become -10, and 191.03 will become 200.     This is useful for plots where axes limits are directly taken from dataframe or ndarray and so on.
